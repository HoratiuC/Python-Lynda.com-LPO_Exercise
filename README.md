# Python-Lynda.com-LPO_Exercise
Simplified version of Lake Pend Oreille Program for Lynda.com/CodeClinic Course.  

Because the website used in the course changed its structure and the data is not available anymore, I have used the data available here: https://github.com/lyndadotcom/LPO_weatherdata  
I have centralized all data in one csv file, and I created a GUI which calcuulates mean and median for air temperature and barometric pressure for each year, or for all years.
